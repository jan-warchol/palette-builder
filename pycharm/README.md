Monochrome Pycharm
------------------

Monochrome theme for Pycharm with background and contrast based on built-in
darkula theme. This is work in progress; not all token types are styled.

Installation
------------

1. Download `.icls` file.
1. In Pycharm, go to Settings => Editor => Color Scheme => cog button => Import
   Scheme... and select downloaded file

Contributing
------------

If you'd like to style more tokens, please try following [guidelines from
README](../README.md) and using only colors from the palette below:

    #2c2c2c
    #383838
    #4b4b4b
    #6d6d6d
    #7f7f7f
    #919191
    #a3a3a3
    #b6b6b6
    #dddddd
    #c9c9c9

Also, try to avoid Pycharm-specific styles (like wavy/dotted line), so that the
theme will be easily portable to other editors. Italic, bold and underline are
fine.
